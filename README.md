I'm a passionate Physical Design Engineer diving deep into the fascinating world of Digital ASIC Design. You know what gets me excited? Solving complex design puzzles! I'm the go-to person for the toughest projects because I thrive on discovering fresh perspectives and refusing to back down until I crack the code.

While I geek out with the latest technology and tools, what truly lights me up is people! Learning from seasoned Engineers is like hitting the jackpot for me. My main aim? Working shoulder to shoulder with a team to consistently achieve greatness while soaking up every bit of knowledge in Physical Design.

My sweet spot? ASIC design, Timing Analysis (STA), Physical Design, and Logic Synthesis.

ðŸ”­ Right now, I'm neck-deep in ASIC Design, juggling Verilog, SystemVerilog, STA, and PnR intricacies.       

ðŸ’¬ Got burning questions about ASIC Design? I'm your person for all things Verilog, VHDL, STA, or PnR.

ðŸ’¼ Whether you need guidance or have a cool project brewing, count me in! Plus, I'm on the lookout for new opportunities, eager to bring my expertise to the table.
Give me a shout-outâ€”I'm all ears and geared up to make a positive impact!
